{"question": "What are the three types of checkers in Pylint?", "answer": "Raw checkers, token checkers, and AST (astroid) checkers."}
{"question": "What are the different reporter types in Pylint?", "answer": "Built‑in Pylint reporters (selectable via --output-format) include:\n- text (TextReporter)\n- colorized (ColorizedTextReporter)\n- parseable (ParseableTextReporter)\n- msvs (MSVSReporter, Visual Studio format)\n- json (JSONReporter; legacy)\n- json2 (JSON2Reporter; preferred JSON format)\n- github (GitHubReporter, for GitHub Actions annotations)\n\nAll reporters derive from BaseReporter. There’s also a CollectingReporter for programmatic use."}
{"question": "What is the structure of Pylint's configuration system?", "answer": "- Sources and precedence: Defaults < configuration files (pyproject.toml under [tool.pylint], pylintrc, setup.cfg/tox.ini with sections starting with “pylint”) with per-directory stacking < command-line options. Command-line always overrides file settings; files override defaults.\n- Core components:\n  - _ArgumentsManager: orchestrates option definition, parsing, and merging from all sources; supports hierarchical/per-directory configuration and help generation.\n  - _ArgumentsProvider: base class implemented by PyLinter, checkers, and plugins to declare and expose their configurable options.\n  - _ConfigurationFileParser: reads and normalizes config files (INI and TOML/pyproject.toml), expands paths/env vars, converts entries to option values, and reports parse errors.\n  - Option model (_Argument hierarchy): defines option metadata (type, default, help, groups), type conversion/validation, and supports checker-specific options.\n- Integration: Tightly integrated with PyLinter and the plugin system; external checkers/plugins register their options automatically. Supports per-directory configs so different parts of a codebase can have different settings."}
{"question": "What is the role of the _ArgumentsManager class in Pylint's configuration system?", "answer": "The _ArgumentsManager is Pylint’s central configuration hub. It builds the argparse parser and shared config namespace, registers options from all providers (checkers, reporters), loads defaults, parses config files (e.g., pylintrc/setup.cfg INI and pyproject.toml/TOML) and command-line arguments with proper precedence (CLI > config > defaults), maintains per-directory/hierarchical namespaces, provides a unified API to get/set options and help, and can generate minimal configuration files."}
{"question": "What is the difference between visit and leave methods in Pylint checkers?", "answer": "- visit_* methods: Called when entering a node (pre-order), before its children. Use them to initialize/push state and run checks that don’t depend on the node’s children.\n- leave_* methods: Called after all children have been processed (post-order). Use them to run checks that need the full subtree, emit messages, and clean up/pop state.\n\nPylint discovers these methods by their naming convention (visit_<node>, leave_<node>) during AST traversal."}
{"question": "What is the structure of messages in Pylint?", "answer": "Pylint messages are structured objects with these key fields:\n\n- Message ID and symbol: a unique code (e.g., E0001) and a human-readable symbol (e.g., syntax-error).\n- Text: the descriptive message, optionally with formatting arguments.\n- Category/severity: derived from the first letter of the ID (C/R/W/E/F for convention, refactor, warning, error, fatal) and a human-readable category.\n- Confidence: how certain the checker is about the finding.\n- Location: file path (path/abspath), module, object (function/class), line and column, plus optional end_line and end_column.\n- Context/metadata: module and object names; optional extra data.\n\nMessages are created by checkers (e.g., via add_message) and formatted by reporters for output."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the confidence level in Pylint's diagnostic messages?", "answer": "It indicates how certain Pylint is about a reported issue—categorized as HIGH, CONTROL_FLOW, INFERENCE, INFERENCE_FAILURE, or UNDEFINED—so you can judge reliability and filter which diagnostics to show or ignore."}
{"question": "What is the role of the severity level in Pylint's message classification system?", "answer": "Pylint’s severity level encodes how serious a message is (the leading letter of the ID, e.g., C, R, W, E, F) and drives prioritization and handling. It determines how messages are grouped and reported, whether they may abort analysis (F), and which can be filtered, enabled, or ignored—letting users focus on the most critical issues first."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Pylint's PyLinter class and the BaseChecker class in establishing the connection between the main linter and individual checkers?", "answer": "PyLinter is the coordinator; BaseChecker is the base for individual checkers.\n\n- Each checker subclasses BaseChecker and is instantiated with the PyLinter instance. BaseChecker stores this linter reference and uses it to access config/resources and to report messages (e.g., add_message delegates to the linter).\n- PyLinter.register_checker registers a checker, its options, and its message definitions into the linter’s registry.\n- During a run, PyLinter manages checker lifecycle (open/close) and drives analysis (AST/raw/token walking), which dispatches visit/leave methods on the registered checkers.\n\nThus, PyLinter owns and orchestrates the checkers, while each checker holds a back-reference to PyLinter to read settings and emit diagnostics."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Pylint's ASTWalker class and the Checker classes in establishing the connection between AST traversal and rule checking?", "answer": "Pylint’s ASTWalker implements a visitor-style dispatcher that links AST traversal to rule checking:\n\n- Registration: When a checker is added, ASTWalker inspects it for methods named visit_<node> and leave_<node> (where <node> is the astroid node class name, lowercased). It indexes these callbacks by node type, typically registering only those tied to enabled messages to avoid unnecessary work.\n- Traversal: For each AST node, ASTWalker calls all matching visit_* callbacks, then recursively walks the node’s children, and finally calls all matching leave_* callbacks. \n\nThis pre/post (top-down/bottom-up) scheme lets multiple checkers run in a single traversal: ASTWalker orchestrates the walk and callback order, while checkers focus on their analysis and message emission."}
{"question": "What dependencies exist between Pylint's astroid library and the checker system?", "answer": "- One-way dependency: Pylint’s checker system depends on astroid; astroid does not depend on the checkers.\n- Ast source model: Checkers operate on astroid’s enhanced AST (NodeNG hierarchy), not Python’s stdlib ast.\n- Traversal/dispatch: The AST walker uses astroid’s traversal API (get_children, is_statement, etc.) and dispatches checker callbacks by astroid node class names (visit_<nodeclassname_lower>/leave_<...>). Renaming node classes in astroid changes which checker methods are invoked.\n- Analysis features: Checkers rely on astroid’s type inference, import resolution, and cross-module analysis to perform sophisticated checks.\n- Robustness/metadata: Checkers use astroid’s error-tolerant building, exceptions (e.g., AstroidBuildingError), and precise location/semantic info.\n- Practical flow: Pylint builds astroid Module trees for files, traverses them with the walker, and runs checkers; improvements in astroid directly benefit all AST-based checkers."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Pylint's configuration system and checker behavior?", "answer": "Pylint’s checkers are driven by a unified, hierarchical configuration system. Each checker declares its own options, which are exposed via config files and the CLI and are available to the checker at runtime (via the linter’s config). Those options let users enable/disable messages, tune thresholds and aggressiveness, and ignore specific patterns. Global config also governs which checkers/messages are active, which files are analyzed, and which plugins are loaded; modes like error-only further filter outputs. Per-directory/project configs allow different parts of a codebase to override settings. In short, configuration directly determines which checks run and how each checker behaves and reports."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint implement a hook-based plugin system instead of inheritance-based extension mechanisms?", "answer": "Because Pylint needs many independently developed extensions to load, coexist, and evolve without coupling to its core classes. A hook-based system lets plugins register checkers/reporters at runtime via a stable, minimal API, enabling:\n\n- Dynamic, config-driven loading/unloading without subclassing PyLinter\n- Loose coupling and backward compatibility as the core evolves\n- Composition of multiple plugins on the same hooks without inheritance conflicts\n- Easier testing and maintenance than deep inheritance hierarchies\n- Better compatibility with multiprocessing/pickling\n\nIn short, hooks provide modularity and runtime extensibility that inheritance-based mechanisms can’t match for Pylint’s plugin model."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint use a message-based reporting system instead of direct output to stdout?", "answer": "Because Pylint separates analysis from presentation. It collects structured messages (with IDs, location, severity, etc.) and hands them to pluggable reporters instead of printing directly to stdout. This design enables multiple and simultaneous output formats and destinations, filtering and aggregation with deferred display, programmatic access for IDE/CI integration, easier testing, and straightforward extensibility. MultiReporter can fan out the same messages to several reporters without stdout interference."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint use astroid instead of the standard library's ast module?", "answer": "Because the stdlib ast only gives a bare syntax tree, while Pylint needs semantic information. Astroid builds a richer, inferable node graph with type/value inference, import and attribute resolution, scope/parent relationships, and helper APIs. Pylint’s checkers are written against this API, enabling more accurate, advanced static analysis than the plain ast can provide."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint implement a multi-phase analysis process instead of single-pass linting?", "answer": "Pylint uses multiple phases because many checks need information that must be built first, and a single pass can’t provide it. In particular:\n- Dependency/context building: earlier phases perform parsing, import/symbol resolution, and (limited) type inference so later checks have the needed context, including cross-scope and cross-file data.\n- Modularity/extensibility: parsing, inference, checking, and reporting are separated, making maintenance and plugin integration easier.\n- Accuracy: stateful traversals and deferred aggregation reduce false positives and enable checks that require whole-module or project-wide knowledge.\n- Performance: expensive work (e.g., AST building) is done once and reused; phases can be optimized, skipped by config, or parallelized.\n- Robustness: errors in one phase don’t sink the whole run; useful diagnostics can still be produced.\n- Scalability: supports incremental updates and better resource management on large codebases."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint implement a plugin-based architecture instead of a monolithic linting system?", "answer": "Pylint uses a plugin-based architecture to keep the core small while making linting flexible and sustainable:\n\n- Extensibility: new checkers and reporters can be added without changing the core; third parties can contribute easily.\n- Modularity/separation of concerns: each checker is self-contained (its own messages/options), simplifying maintenance, updates, and testing.\n- Customization: projects can load/enable only the plugins they need via config/CLI, yielding different rule sets and outputs per project.\n- Performance: unused plugins can be disabled to reduce analysis time.\n- Stability/compatibility: features evolve via plugins without breaking existing behavior; failures are isolated.\n\nConcretely, PyLinter dynamically loads and registers plugins (checkers/reporters), lets them add options/messages, and supports safe loading and parallel runs."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint use an AST-based analysis approach instead of regex-based pattern matching?", "answer": "Because linting requires understanding code structure and meaning, not just text. Using the AST lets Pylint analyze scopes, names, control flow and (inferred) types; handle nested Python constructs reliably; reduce false positives; remain stable across formatting/refactors and language changes; and support complex, maintainable checks. Regex can’t capture these contexts and is brittle for real-world Python code."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint provide multiple severity levels for different types of issues?", "answer": "Because issues vary in seriousness and intent, Pylint classifies messages (info, convention, refactor, warning, error, fatal) so developers and tools can:\n\n- Prioritize fixes (bugs before style).\n- Configure and filter checks (e.g., errors-only, enable/disable by category).\n- Integrate with CI/CD (fail builds on high severity, tolerate lower).\n- Adopt rules gradually and align team workflows/resources.\n- Improve reporting and IDE UX via severity-based grouping/indicators.\n\nThese levels also map to distinct exit codes, enabling reliable automation."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint include confidence levels in its diagnostic messages?", "answer": "Because static analysis in Python involves uncertainty, Pylint tags each message with a confidence level to indicate how reliable the finding is. This lets users and tools prioritize and filter diagnostics (reducing noise and false positives) and configure reporting (e.g., via --confidence). Common levels include HIGH, CONTROL_FLOW, INFERENCE, INFERENCE_FAILURE, and UNDEFINED."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint's AST-based analysis impact performance compared to regex-based linting tools?", "answer": "- AST construction: Pylint parses each file into a full abstract syntax tree, which is far costlier than linearly scanning text with regex.\n- Higher memory: Holding and walking the AST for every module consumes significantly more memory.\n- Deeper semantics: Type inference, scope/data-flow analysis, and import resolution (building module dependencies) add substantial CPU work.\n- Multiple passes: Many checks require full-tree traversals and repeated passes over the code.\n- State/context management: Maintaining symbol tables, message stores, and per-checker state introduces overhead.\n- Checker dispatch/framework cost: Plugin-based checker callbacks over AST nodes add indirection and per-node dispatch cost.\n- Robustness overhead: Error recovery and richer diagnostics in AST processing further increase work.\n- Harder caching: Effective caching of structured AST analysis is more complex than caching simple text scans.\n\nRegex-based tools mostly do single-pass pattern matching without structure or context, so they’re much faster but less precise."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint's plugin system impact memory usage and performance in large codebases?", "answer": "- Plugin loading imports each plugin module and keeps it resident, adding startup time and baseline memory.\n- Each plugin registers and instantiates additional checkers and message definitions, enlarging Pylint’s internal registries and per-checker state.\n- For every file, Pylint tokenizes and walks the AST while invoking all enabled checkers; more plugins mean more callbacks and work per file.\n- Extra configuration/initialization and coordination across plugins add processing overhead; in parallel runs, some checker state may be duplicated, increasing memory.\n- In large codebases this cost scales roughly with number of enabled plugins times number of files, amplifying both memory use and runtime."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint implement caching mechanisms for repeated analysis?", "answer": "To make repeated runs faster and lighter. Pylint caches intermediate results (e.g., parsed ASTs, import/import graph resolution, type inference, configuration and plugin data, message definitions, file discovery and stats) so it doesn’t recompute them on unchanged code. This improves performance and resource usage, scales better on large codebases and CI, and enables efficient incremental analysis when only some files change; caches are invalidated/clearable to avoid stale results."}
{"question": "Why does Pylint use incremental analysis for performance optimization?", "answer": "To avoid redundant work across runs. Pylint detects which files changed, tracks dependencies, and reuses cached analysis artifacts (e.g., results, ASTs, import/type inference, config/plugin state) for unchanged files. By re-analyzing only changed files and affected dependents, it significantly reduces time and memory, especially in large codebases and frequent IDE runs."}
{"question": "Where does Pylint's analysis flow from source file parsing through AST traversal to final message generation?", "answer": "Pylint’s analysis flows through a fixed pipeline coordinated by PyLinter:\n\n- File selection: determine which files to lint (patterns/exclusions).\n- Parsing: each file is parsed with astroid to build an enhanced AST.\n- Pre-AST checks: raw and token checkers run on the file content/token stream.\n- AST traversal: an AST walker visits nodes and dispatches visit/leave callbacks to registered checkers.\n- Checker analysis: checkers inspect nodes/scope/state and call add_message to emit diagnostics.\n- Message handling: messages are collected and filtered/enabled per configuration.\n- Reporting: the configured reporter formats messages (and any summary reports) and writes the final output."}
{"question": "Where does Pylint's checker system flow from checker registration through rule application to violation reporting?", "answer": "- Registration: Each checker module exposes register(linter), which instantiates the checker and calls linter.register_checker(...). Its options and message definitions are registered with the linter’s configuration/message system.\n- Initialization: When linting starts, PyLinter initializes checkers and calls their open() hooks.\n- File analysis setup: For each file, PyLinter tokenizes source and builds the astroid tree.\n- Rule application: \n  - Raw/token checkers run via process_module/process_tokens.\n  - AST-based checkers are dispatched by the walker over the astroid tree, invoking visit_* and leave_* methods to apply rules.\n- Violation creation: When a rule is violated, a checker calls add_message(msgid, …) using its registered message definitions.\n- Collection and filtering: PyLinter collects messages, applies enables/disables, confidence/filters, and deduplicates as needed.\n- Reporting: The reporter formats and emits the final diagnostics."}
{"question": "Where does the configuration loading flow from file discovery to checker initialization?", "answer": "Pylint’s configuration loading flow (from configuration file discovery to checker initialization) is:\n\n- Configuration file discovery (searches current and parent directories; supports .pylintrc/pylintrc, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml).\n- File format detection.\n- Configuration parsing into internal data structures.\n- Command-line argument parsing and merge with file-based config.\n- Precedence resolution (CLI > project files > defaults).\n- Option validation (correctness and compatibility).\n- Default value application for unspecified options.\n- Checker option integration (including message enable/disable).\n- Configuration distribution to relevant components.\n- Checker initialization with the effective configuration."}
{"question": "Where does the message reporting flow from checker detection to final output generation?", "answer": "- Detection: A checker (BaseChecker subclass) finds an issue during analysis and calls BaseChecker.add_message(...).\n- Linter intake: add_message forwards to PyLinter.add_message/_add_one_message (pylint/lint/pylinter.py).\n- Processing: PyLinter builds the Message, applies config-based filtering (enable/disable, severity, confidence, scope), enriches with context (location/module), updates stats, and aggregates.\n- Reporting: PyLinter forwards the message to the active Reporter via reporter.handle_message (e.g., TextReporter in pylint/reporters/).\n- Output: The reporter formats and emits messages; at run end it produces any summary reports (display_reports), writing to stdout or configured output."}
{"question": "Where in Pylint's codebase are the checker configuration settings stored?", "answer": "- Declared per checker: each checker class defines its options (e.g., an options list/tuple) in the modules under pylint/checkers/ and pylint/extensions/.\n- Stored at runtime: after parsing, all values are centralized on the linter’s configuration object, PyLinter.config (accessible to checkers as self.linter.config), managed by Pylint’s config/arguments manager."}
{"question": "Where does Pylint store its message configuration and severity level management?", "answer": "- Message definitions: Each checker declares its messages (msgs dict), which are registered in PyLinter’s msgs_store (MessageDefinition/MessageDefinitionStore) with ID/symbol mapping via MessageIdStore.\n- Severity/categories: Defined centrally in pylint.constants (message types I/C/R/W/E/F and related mappings).\n- Message state (enable/disable): Managed by pylint.lint.message_state_handler._MessageStateHandler, with global/module/line scopes and per-file state in linter.file_state; mirrored/configured via linter.config.\n- Configuration sources: Project/user config files (e.g., pylintrc/pyproject/setup.cfg) with per-directory cascading, command‑line options, and inline pragmas; plugins can register additional messages."}
{"question": "Where in Pylint's codebase is the AST parsing and transformation logic implemented?", "answer": "Pylint itself does not implement AST parsing/transformations; it delegates them to the Astroid library. The parsing and transformation logic lives in Astroid (notably astroid.builder, astroid.manager, and astroid.transforms). In Pylint’s codebase you’ll find only the integration/traversal:\n- pylint/lint/pylinter.py (PyLinter.get_ast and related methods) to obtain Astroid trees\n- pylint/utils/ast_walker.py for walking the Astroid AST\n- checker visit_/leave_ methods under pylint/checkers/ for analysis on Astroid nodes"}
{"question": "Where does Pylint implement its plugin loading and management system?", "answer": "- Core: pylint/lint/pylinter.py — in the PyLinter class, chiefly load_plugin_modules() (and the hook runner load_plugin_configuration()), which read the load-plugins option and register plugin-provided checkers/reporters.\n- Discovery helper: pylint/utils/utils.py — register_plugins(), which scans a package for modules and calls their register() function.\n- Built-in extensions: pylint/extensions/__init__.py — uses register_plugins() to load and register the bundled extensions."}
{"question": "Where in Pylint's codebase is the \"visit_functiondef\" method defined?", "answer": "There isn’t a single, central definition. visit_functiondef is a visitor hook implemented by many Pylint checkers. You’ll find it scattered across checker classes under pylint/checkers and in optional plugins under pylint/extensions (e.g., variables-related, classes/methods checks, design/metrics, docstring/params, name checks). In practice, search the codebase for “def visit_functiondef(” to see all implementations; the AST walker dispatches to each checker’s method when visiting a FunctionDef node."}
{"question": "Where is the \"add_message\" method defined in the message reporting hierarchy?", "answer": "- BaseChecker (pylint/checkers/base_checker.py): defines add_message for checkers and delegates to the linter.\n- PyLinter (pylint/lint/pylinter.py): defines the core add_message logic that records/reports messages.\n- UnittestLinter (pylint/testutils/unittest_linter.py): test subclass that overrides add_message to capture messages in tests."}
{"question": "Where in Pylint's codebase is the \"BaseChecker\" class defined?", "answer": "pylint/checkers/base_checker.py (module: pylint.checkers.base_checker)"}
{"question": "Where are Pylint's built-in checker implementations located?", "answer": "In the pylint/checkers/ package of the Pylint source tree (including its modules and subpackages)."}
{"question": "How does Pylint's architecture support extensibility through plugins?", "answer": "Pylint is extensible by treating a plugin as a Python module that exposes a register(linter) entry point. At runtime (via --load-plugins or built-in extensions), PyLinter imports the module and calls register, where the plugin uses the public API to:\n\n- register checkers (subclassing BaseChecker) and reporters (subclassing BaseReporter), and optionally transformers\n- define messages and options, which are merged into Pylint’s message registry, configuration, and help output\n\nRegistered checkers are integrated into the analysis lifecycle (open/close hooks) and have full access to the AST/tokens via visit/leave methods, allowing them to emit custom diagnostics. The loader avoids duplicate loads and isolates errors so a faulty plugin doesn’t crash the run. This design lets plugins extend behavior without modifying Pylint’s core."}
{"question": "How does Pylint ensure backward compatibility when introducing new features?", "answer": "- Deprecate first, remove later: new features come with deprecation warnings for old behavior and a multi-release grace period before removal.\n- Compatibility shims and aliases: old option names, message symbols/IDs, and APIs continue to work (mapped to the new ones) while emitting deprecation notices.\n- Message stability and migration maps: existing message IDs/symbols are preserved whenever possible; when renamed/removed, mappings keep configs from breaking.\n- Stable public and plugin APIs: interfaces change only via deprecation cycles; plugins are kept working across releases.\n- Conservative defaults and gating: new or stricter behavior is introduced in a non-breaking way (e.g., opt-in flags, version gating), with default changes reserved for major releases.\n- Clear migration support: release notes and guides document changes and timelines; extensive tests guard against regressions."}
{"question": "How does Pylint's design facilitate integration with other development tools?", "answer": "- Pluggable reporters with multiple machine-readable formats (text, JSON/JSON2, parseable, MSVS, etc.), and the ability to emit multiple formats at once.\n- Consistent, structured messages (ID/symbol, severity, file:line:col) that are easy for tools to parse.\n- Predictable exit codes and CI-friendly controls (e.g., minimum-score/fail-under, fail on specific messages) for policy enforcement.\n- Flexible configuration via pyproject.toml/pylintrc/setup.cfg and environment variables, plus inline/CLI enable/disable and message filtering.\n- Public, embeddable API and modular architecture (PyLinter, reporters, checkers) for programmatic use and custom plugins/rules.\n- Parallel execution (-j) and selective file checking to fit large codebases and CI/editor workflows."}
{"question": "How does Pylint implement its configuration management system?", "answer": "- Core design: an argparse-based ArgumentsManager owns all options and merges configuration from every source into a single namespace.\n- Extensibility: linter, checkers, and plugins implement an ArgumentsProvider interface to dynamically register their options (grouped by sections).\n- Sources and formats: supports rc/INI files (pylintrc, .pylintrc, setup.cfg), TOML (pyproject.toml under [tool.pylint]), and command-line flags; environment variables (e.g., PYLINTRC/PYLINTHOME) help discover configuration and data paths.\n- Parsing model: config files are read and turned into synthetic argv for argparse, so types, defaults, and validation are consistently applied.\n- Precedence: defaults < parent configs < nearer/per-directory configs < command line (last value wins); per-directory configs inherit from parents.\n- Validation and errors: unknown or invalid options and parse errors are surfaced with clear errors; deprecated option names may be kept as aliases.\n- Generation: can emit a ready-to-edit configuration template (e.g., via generate-rcfile)."}
{"question": "How does Pylint optimize its AST traversal for large codebases?", "answer": "- Precomputed dispatch per node type: Pylint’s AST walker builds a mapping from node kinds to the exact visit/leave callbacks, so traversal does a direct lookup instead of scanning all checkers for every node.\n- Message-gated callback registration: Only callbacks from enabled messages/checkers are registered, avoiding work for disabled checks during traversal.\n- Method/dispatch caching: Visitor method resolution is cached to prevent repeated attribute lookups while walking the tree.\n- Inference and module caching (via astroid): Parsed modules and type-inference results are memoized, and imported modules are reused instead of reparsed, cutting repeated AST/inference work across a run.\n- Parallelism across files: With -j/--jobs, files are analyzed in parallel, reducing wall-clock time on large codebases.\n- Scope reduction by configuration: Ignoring paths/patterns and disabling unused checkers/plugins reduces the amount of AST that must be traversed."}
{"question": "How does Pylint implement its caching mechanism to improve performance?", "answer": "Pylint speeds up repeated runs with two kinds of caches:\n\n- In‑memory (per run): via astroid’s internal caches (e.g., inference/import resolution caches) so types, lookups, and AST-related computations aren’t recomputed within the same run.\n\n- Persistent (across runs): it writes per‑module persistent data to a cache directory determined by PYLINT_HOME (default ~/.pylint.d). Cache files are named from the module path (sanitized, with recursion/scope encoded) and are pickled (e.g., linter stats and related analysis metadata). On subsequent runs Pylint attempts to load this data; if it’s present and valid (version/format checks), it reuses it and skips rebuilding the same metadata; otherwise it recomputes and overwrites the cache. If loading fails, the cache is ignored."}
{"question": "How does Pylint handle multi-threading in its analysis process?", "answer": "Pylint does not use multi-threading for analysis. It parallelizes via multiprocessing when you set -j/--jobs: each worker is a separate process with its own PyLinter instance that analyzes files independently. Results (messages, stats, map/reduce data) are collected and aggregated in the parent process, avoiding shared mutable state and thread-safety issues. This orchestration lives in pylint.lint.parallel."}
{"question": "How does Pylint implement its type inference system?", "answer": "Pylint does not implement its own formal type system; it relies on the Astroid library’s lazy, best‑effort, context/flow‑aware inference over a semantic AST. Pylint drives that engine and augments it with annotations and checker logic:\n\n- Uses type hints/annotations when available; falls back to inference otherwise.\n- Resolves imports, understands builtins, function/method signatures, and class hierarchies/attribute lookups.\n- Infers types per node in context; when uncertain returns multiple candidates or an Uninferable sentinel.\n- Wraps Astroid’s Node.infer with helper utilities and uses an inference context; results are cached for performance.\n- Honors Python version/config to decide how to interpret typing constructs.\n\nThis enables rich, practical type information for linting, but it is not a full PEP 484 type checker."}
{"question": "How does Pylint handle inline disabling of messages?", "answer": "Pylint uses inline “pragmas” in comments to control messages:\n\n- Disable: add a comment with “pylint: disable=<message>[, <message>…]” to suppress specific messages. You can use symbolic names (preferred) or numeric IDs, mixed and comma‑separated.\n- Re‑enable: use “pylint: enable=<message>[, …]”.\n- Next line only: use “pylint: disable-next=<message>[, …]”.\n\nScope depends on placement:\n- At the end of a statement: affects that statement only.\n- On the def/class line: applies to that entire block.\n- On its own line: applies from that point to the end of the current scope (module, class, function) or until a matching “enable”."}
{"question": "How does Pylint support custom linting rules through its API?", "answer": "- Create custom checkers by subclassing Pylint’s checker bases: BaseChecker (AST), BaseTokenChecker (tokens), or BaseRawFileChecker (raw files).\n- Implement analysis via visit_<node_type>/leave_<node_type> hooks for AST (Astroid nodes) or methods like process_tokens/process_module for non-AST checks.\n- Define diagnostics in msgs (IDs, symbols, texts) and emit them with add_message().\n- Expose configurable options; Pylint integrates them into its config/CLI and help.\n- Use lifecycle hooks open() and close() for setup/teardown.\n- Register the checker with a PyLinter via a module-level register(linter) function (which calls linter.register_checker), and load it as a plugin via --load-plugins, pylintrc, or entry points.\n- Checkers have access to the AST and linter/context, enabling sophisticated analyses."}
{"question": "How does Pylint's framework handle version compatibility with Python updates?", "answer": "Pylint handles Python-version compatibility by gating its behavior on a target Python version and the running interpreter, then enabling or disabling checks accordingly.\n\n- Configuration and detection: It reads a configured target version (py-version; default derives from the interpreter) and computes internal “feature flags” for that version.\n- Version‑aware checks: Checkers are conditional on those flags. They warn about using features not supported by the target version, and about stdlib APIs or syntax that are deprecated or removed in specific releases.\n- Data tables for deprecations/features: Pylint maintains per-version maps of deprecated modules/APIs and feature availability to drive messages.\n- Syntax/AST compatibility: Its AST and import/type inference layer (via astroid) is updated for new grammar and typing features so analysis works across Python releases.\n- Backward compatibility and QA: It keeps support for older versions where feasible and tests across multiple Python versions, with docs updated as Python evolves.\n\nThis lets Pylint adapt to new Python features while remaining accurate for projects targeting different Python versions."}
{"question": "How does Pylint implement its plugin API for third-party extensions?", "answer": "- Model: Plugins are plain Python modules that expose a register(linter) function. Pylint imports these modules and calls register with the PyLinter instance.\n- Loading: Modules are loaded dynamically via the load-plugins configuration/CLI flag (and Pylint’s built-in pylint.extensions package). Internally, PyLinter.load_plugin_modules handles import and registration.\n- Registration: Inside register, plugins call linter.register_checker(...) for custom checkers (subclasses of BaseChecker, typically implementing IAstroidChecker hooks), and may register reporters (subclasses of BaseReporter).\n- Hooks and lifecycle: Checkers can implement open(), close(), process_module, and visit_/leave_ AST-node methods; Pylint drives these during analysis.\n- Messages: Plugins declare their own messages and emit them via the standard message system; users can enable/disable them like core messages.\n- Configuration: Checker-defined options are automatically integrated into Pylint’s config/help system and surfaced via CLI/pylintrc.\n- Analysis API: Checkers operate on astroid’s AST, enabling deep static analysis consistent with Pylint core behavior."}
