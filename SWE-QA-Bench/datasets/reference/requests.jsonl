{"question": "What are the core components of Requests' HTTP client?", "answer": "- Session: manages persistent settings, cookies, and connection pooling; mounts adapters.\n- Request and PreparedRequest: build and prepare requests for sending.\n- Response: represents the HTTP response (status, headers, body, helpers).\n- HTTPAdapter (BaseAdapter): transport layer built on urllib3 for connection pooling, retries, and proxies."}
{"question": "What is Requests' adapter system?", "answer": "Requests’ adapter system is its transport abstraction: a Session maintains a registry that maps URL prefixes (e.g., http://, https:// or more specific hosts/paths) to transport adapters. By default, HTTPAdapter is mounted for HTTP/HTTPS; the longest matching mount handles a request. Adapters implement send for PreparedRequest and provide connection pooling, retries, proxy support, and SSL/TLS (via urllib3). You can mount or subclass adapters to customize or replace the transport behavior."}
{"question": "What are Requests' built-in authentication handlers?", "answer": "HTTPBasicAuth, HTTPDigestAuth, and HTTPProxyAuth (all deriving from AuthBase)."}
{"question": "What is the structure of Requests' response object?", "answer": "Requests’ Response object exposes:\n\n- Core metadata:\n  - status_code (int), reason (str), ok (bool)\n  - url (final URL), history (list[Response]), next (PreparedRequest or None)\n  - elapsed (datetime.timedelta)\n\n- Headers, cookies, links:\n  - headers (case-insensitive dict)\n  - cookies (RequestsCookieJar)\n  - links (dict parsed from the Link header)\n\n- Body and encoding:\n  - content (bytes), text (str), json(**kwargs)\n  - encoding (str|None), apparent_encoding (str|None)\n  - raw (file-like, e.g., urllib3 response)\n\n- Request reference:\n  - request (PreparedRequest)\n\n- Redirect flags:\n  - is_redirect (bool), is_permanent_redirect (bool)\n\n- Streaming/utility:\n  - iter_content(...), iter_lines(...)\n  - raise_for_status(), close()\n  - Iterable (yields content chunks)\n  - Context manager support (with ... as r:)\n\nRepr: \"<Response [<status_code>]>\"."}
{"question": "What is the precise definition of Requests' \"Session\" concept in terms of connection reuse and state management?", "answer": "A Requests Session is a stateful client that both reuses connections and persists request state:\n\n- Connection reuse: A Session holds per-prefix HTTPAdapter instances backed by urllib3 connection pools. Requests to the same scheme/host reuse pooled TCP connections (keep‑alive). Calling close() or using the Session as a context manager tears down the adapters/pools, ending reuse.\n\n- State management: A Session maintains a CookieJar and default request settings (e.g., headers, auth, params, proxies, SSL verification/cert, hooks, stream, trust_env, max_redirects). For each request, these defaults are merged with per-request arguments; responses update the Session’s CookieJar."}
{"question": "What is the exact meaning of Requests' \"adapter\" concept and its abstraction of underlying transport mechanisms?", "answer": "In Requests, an adapter is the pluggable transport layer for a Session. It implements the BaseAdapter interface (send, close) and is “mounted” on a Session for specific URL prefixes; the longest matching mount handles a request. The default HTTPAdapter (for http:// and https://) uses urllib3 to perform all network I/O and protocol work—connection pooling, TLS/SSL, proxies, timeouts, retries—and converts results/errors into Requests’ Response/exceptions. Thus, adapters abstract and isolate the underlying transport so you can swap or customize it (per scheme or domain) without changing the Requests API you use."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the PreparedRequest class in Requests' request preparation system?", "answer": "PreparedRequest is Requests’ finalized, sendable form of a Request. It assembles and normalizes the method, URL, headers, cookies, body, auth, and hooks into the exact wire format, produced by Request.prepare() or Session.prepare_request(), and is what Session.send (and adapters) actually transmit."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Response class in Requests' HTTP response handling?", "answer": "The Response class is Requests’ high-level wrapper around an HTTP reply. It encapsulates the underlying urllib3 response and exposes status_code, headers, cookies, final URL and redirect history, elapsed time, and the body via content (bytes), text (decoded), and json(). It supports streaming (iter_content/iter_lines), redirect info (is_redirect/is_permanent_redirect, links), and error handling via raise_for_status(). It retains the originating PreparedRequest (request), can be closed or used as a context manager to release the connection, and evaluates truthy for non-error (status < 400) responses."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Requests' Session class and the PreparedRequest class in establishing request preparation and execution?", "answer": "Session manages request lifecycle and shared state (headers, params, auth, cookies, hooks). Session.prepare_request merges these with per-call data to produce a PreparedRequest—the final, ready-to-send HTTP message (method, URL, headers, body). Session.send accepts only a PreparedRequest and transmits it via the adapter, handling connection pooling, redirects, cookie updates, and errors. The high-level flow is: Request → PreparedRequest (via Session.prepare_request) → send (via Session.send)."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Requests' Response class and the Request class in establishing outgoing requests and incoming responses?", "answer": "- Outgoing: A Request (via Session) is prepared into a PreparedRequest and sent.\n- Incoming: The server’s reply is a Response.\n- Link: Each Response holds a back-reference to the exact PreparedRequest that was sent via response.request, letting you trace which request produced the response.\n- Redirects: response.history contains prior Response objects (and thus their requests), maintaining the chain."}
{"question": "What dependencies exist between Requests' adapter system and the underlying transport libraries?", "answer": "Requests’ built-in HTTPAdapter is a thin layer over urllib3 and depends on it for nearly all transport duties: it constructs and manages urllib3 connection pools (PoolManager/ProxyManager, including SOCKS via urllib3.contrib.socks), performs I/O via urlopen, handles SSL/TLS, proxies, retries and timeouts, and wraps urllib3.HTTPResponse into Requests’ Response. It also maps urllib3 exceptions (e.g., MaxRetryError, SSLError) to Requests’ exceptions and enforces a compatible urllib3 version. While custom adapters can be mounted, the default HTTP transport is tightly coupled to urllib3."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between Requests' authentication handlers and the session management system?", "answer": "Requests’ auth handlers and sessions are integrated: a Session can hold a default auth handler (tuple or AuthBase), while per-request auth can override it. During request preparation, the Session merges these settings and invokes the handler to modify the PreparedRequest (e.g., add Authorization). The Session also manages state: it persists cookies (including those set during auth handshakes) and handles redirects, keeping auth on same-origin redirects and stripping it on cross-host redirects. This provides persistent, overridable authentication across multiple requests and works the same for one-off requests."}
{"question": "Why does Requests implement a session-based connection pooling instead of creating new connections for each request?", "answer": "Because establishing a new TCP/TLS connection for every request is expensive. A Session keeps persistent transport adapters backed by urllib3’s connection pools, so connections to the same host/port are reused (HTTP/1.1 keep‑alive). This eliminates repeated DNS lookups and handshakes, reducing latency and socket usage, lowering server/network load, and improving throughput and scalability. A Session also preserves state and configuration (cookies, headers, auth, proxies, TLS/certs) across requests, and its pools (configurable via pool sizes) are managed and closed with the Session."}
{"question": "Why does Requests use a prepared request pattern instead of sending raw HTTP requests directly?", "answer": "Because Requests must fully normalize a request before I/O. Preparing builds the exact bytes to send by merging session/env defaults, validating and IDNA-encoding the URL and params, assembling headers/cookies, encoding the body, and deciding Content-Length vs Transfer-Encoding. Auth/signing is applied last so it operates on the final representation. This separation (Request vs PreparedRequest) yields an immutable snapshot that’s safe to send, retry, or redirect, with body position tracking, consistent hooks, and a single processing pipeline. Session.send only accepts a PreparedRequest to enforce correctness, extensibility, and reproducibility."}
{"question": "Why does Requests use an adapter pattern for transport abstraction instead of direct HTTP library integration?", "answer": "Because Requests separates high-level HTTP API concerns from low-level I/O. It exposes a small, stable transport interface (BaseAdapter with send/close), while the default HTTPAdapter encapsulates urllib3 details (connection pooling, proxies, TLS, retries). Adapters can be mounted per scheme/host/path, letting users swap or specialize transports without changing Session or request/response logic. This keeps Requests modular, testable (mock adapters), maintainable, and future‑proof, whereas direct integration would tightly couple it to a specific HTTP library and reduce flexibility."}
{"question": "Why does Requests implement a unified interface for different HTTP methods instead of separate classes?", "answer": "Because all HTTP methods share the same mechanics, Requests treats the method as a parameter to a single request/PreparedRequest pipeline. This keeps the API simple and consistent, reuses features uniformly (headers, cookies, auth, hooks, sessions, error handling), avoids duplication (DRY), and makes testing, maintenance, and docs easier. Method-specific behavior is applied conditionally during preparation, and new methods can be added by routing through the same core."}
{"question": "Why does Requests implement a session-based architecture instead of stateless individual requests?", "answer": "Because real-world HTTP use benefits from shared state and reused resources. A Requests Session:\n\n- Reuses TCP connections via connection pooling (adapters), cutting handshake overhead and improving performance.\n- Persists cookies (and thus authentication/session state) across requests.\n- Centralizes defaults (headers, auth, proxies, params, TLS/verify, hooks), merging them into each request for consistency and less boilerplate.\n- Manages resources cleanly (e.g., pooled connections) with explicit close.\n\nStateless one-off requests would repeatedly reconnect, lose cookies and settings, be slower, and be harder to manage consistently."}
{"question": "Why does Requests use an adapter pattern for transport abstraction instead of direct HTTP library integration?", "answer": "Because Requests separates high-level HTTP API concerns from low-level I/O. It exposes a small, stable transport interface (BaseAdapter with send/close), while the default HTTPAdapter encapsulates urllib3 details (connection pooling, proxies, TLS, retries).

This keeps Requests modular, testable (mock adapters), maintainable, and future‑proof, whereas direct integration would tightly couple it to a specific HTTP library and reduce flexibility."}
{"question": "Why does Requests implement automatic redirect handling instead of manual redirect management?", "answer": "Requests handles redirects automatically because correct redirect handling is complex, security‑sensitive, and standardized:\n\n- Convenience and consistency: Avoids error‑prone, inconsistent manual logic and keeps the API simple.\n- Standards compliance: Follows RFC rules for redirect codes (301/302/303 vs 307/308), URL resolution, and history tracking.\n- Security: Prevents credential leaks (e.g., strips Authorization on cross‑host redirects) and safely rebuilds auth/proxy headers.\n- Session integrity: Preserves cookies, state, and method/body semantics; rewinds streams when needed.\n- Robustness: Handles relative/fragment Locations, malformed headers, connection reuse, and enforces limits (max redirects, TooManyRedirects).\n- Integration: Centralized logic (e.g., SessionRedirectMixin) works seamlessly with cookies, auth, and proxies, while remaining configurable/disableable."}
{"question": "Why does Requests' connection pooling mechanism improve performance compared to creating new connections for each request?", "answer": "Because Requests (via a Session’s HTTPAdapter and urllib3’s PoolManager) reuses open TCP/TLS connections to the same host instead of creating new sockets for every request. This avoids repeated DNS lookups, TCP handshakes, and TLS negotiations, cutting setup latency and CPU cost. Reuse also reduces socket/file‑descriptor churn, improves throughput and scalability, and enables controlled concurrency through a configurable pool size (pool_connections/pool_maxsize), with connection lifecycle, retries, and cleanup handled for you."}
{"question": "Why does Requests' session management system optimize memory usage and performance in high-concurrency scenarios?", "answer": "Because a Session reuses resources instead of recreating them. Concretely:\n- It keeps HTTPAdapter instances that manage urllib3 connection pools, so sockets (and TLS handshakes) are reused per host instead of rebuilt for every request.\n- The pools are thread-safe and bounded (configurable pool_maxsize/pool_connections), letting many concurrent requests share a limited set of connections, which caps memory use and boosts throughput.\n- Shared state (cookies, headers, auth) lives once on the Session and is reused across requests, reducing per-request allocations and work.\n- Adapters are reused and created lazily (looked up by URL prefix), minimizing object churn.\n- Session.close() releases adapter/pool resources, preventing leaks.\n\nTogether these mechanisms cut connection setup cost, limit resource growth under load, and reduce memory overhead in high-concurrency scenarios."}
{"question": "Why does Requests implement connection reuse for performance optimization?", "answer": "Because establishing new connections is expensive. Requests reuses persistent (HTTP/1.1 keep‑alive) connections via urllib3’s connection pooling to avoid repeated TCP/TLS handshakes and DNS lookups and to mitigate TCP slow start. This lowers latency and CPU/network/server load and increases throughput for multiple requests to the same host, with separate pools per host/TLS context to remain correct."}
{"question": "Why does Requests use connection pooling for concurrent request handling?", "answer": "Because reusing connections is faster and safer than creating new ones for every request. Requests (via urllib3’s PoolManager) caches TCP/TLS connections to avoid repeated handshakes, reducing latency and CPU. The pool also caps and coordinates simultaneous connections (pool_connections/pool_maxsize, optional pool_block), preventing socket/file‑descriptor exhaustion and enabling thread‑safe concurrency. Separate pools are kept per connection key (host/scheme/TLS), ensuring correct reuse without mixing incompatible connections."}
{"question": "Why does Requests implement request/response streaming for memory efficiency in large data transfers?", "answer": "Requests implements streaming to prevent loading entire large files or responses into memory at once. With stream=True, only response headers are downloaded initially, keeping the connection open. The iter_content() method yields data in configurable chunks, allowing processing of large files without memory overflow. For uploads, streaming allows sending file-like objects or generators without reading them entirely into memory first, using chunked transfer encoding when the content length is unknown. This enables handling of arbitrarily large data transfers within limited memory constraints."}
{"question": "Where in the Requests codebase does the HTTP request flow begin from the Session object through the adapter layer to the underlying transport?", "answer": "- src/requests/sessions.py: Session.request() → prepare_request() → Session.send() → get_adapter(url)\n- src/requests/adapters.py: HTTPAdapter.send(request)\n- Underlying transport: urllib3 connection/pool (e.g., PoolManager/conn).urlopen(...)"}
{"question": "Where in the Requests codebase does the response flow from the transport layer through the response object back to the user application?", "answer": "- Bridge point: src/requests/adapters.py — HTTPAdapter.send() receives the urllib3.HTTPResponse and calls HTTPAdapter.build_response() to wrap it into a requests.models.Response (setting .raw, status_code, headers, url, cookies, encoding, etc.).\n- Response API: src/requests/models.py — Response exposes content/text/json/iter_content, which read from response.raw (the underlying urllib3 response).\n- Return to user: src/requests/sessions.py — Session.send() (invoked by Session.request()) manages redirects/cookies/hooks and returns the populated Response to the caller."}
{"question": "Where does the authentication flow from handler selection through credential application to request execution?", "answer": "- Handler selection: requests.sessions.Session.prepare_request merges per-request, session, and netrc auth to choose the auth handler.\n- Credential application: requests.models.PreparedRequest.prepare_auth calls the chosen AuthBase handler (__call__), which sets Authorization/Proxy-Authorization headers and (for Digest) registers response hooks.\n- Request execution: requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter.send sends the prepared request; on 401/redirect, auth hooks (e.g., HTTPDigestAuth.handle_401/handle_redirect in requests.auth) may update auth and resend."}
{"question": "Where does the redirect handling flow from response analysis through location extraction to new request creation?", "answer": "- Location: src/requests/sessions.py, class SessionRedirectMixin.\n- Flow: response arrives → get_redirect_target(response) extracts the Location → resolve_redirects(...) normalizes/joins the URL, copies the original prepared request (req.copy()), rebuilds method/auth/proxies/cookies (e.g., via rebuild_method and should_strip_auth) → sends the new request (looping for further redirects).\n- Support: Response.is_redirect in src/requests/models.py helps determine whether a response is a redirect."}
{"question": "Where in the Requests codebase is the core HTTP client implemented?", "answer": "Primarily in requests/adapters.py via the HTTPAdapter (its send method does the actual HTTP I/O using urllib3). It’s orchestrated by the Session in requests/sessions.py (with the public helpers in requests/api.py being thin wrappers over Session)."}
{"question": "Where does Requests store its authentication handlers?", "answer": "In the requests.auth module—i.e., the file requests/auth.py—which defines AuthBase and handlers like HTTPBasicAuth, HTTPDigestAuth, and HTTPProxyAuth."}
{"question": "Where in Requests is the session management system implemented?", "answer": "In Requests, session management is implemented in src/requests/sessions.py, primarily via the Session class (with SessionRedirectMixin handling redirects)."}
{"question": "Where are Requests' built-in adapters defined?", "answer": "In the requests.adapters module—i.e., requests/adapters.py (in the repo: src/requests/adapters.py)."}
{"question": "Where is the \"send\" method defined in the adapter hierarchy?", "answer": "In Requests’ adapter hierarchy, send is declared as an abstract method on BaseAdapter (in requests/adapters.py) and implemented concretely by HTTPAdapter in the same file."}
{"question": "Where in Requests' codebase is the \"Session\" class defined?", "answer": "requests/sessions.py"}
{"question": "Where are Requests' built-in adapter implementations located?", "answer": "In the requests.adapters module, i.e., requests/adapters.py."}
{"question": "Where in Requests' codebase is the 'get' method defined?", "answer": "The 'get' method is defined in two locations: 1) src/requests/api.py at line 62 as a module-level function that calls request('get', url, params=params, **kwargs), and 2) src/requests/sessions.py at line 593 as a method of the Session class that calls self.request('GET', url, **kwargs)"}
{"question": "How does Requests implement its session management system for connection pooling?", "answer": "Requests implements connection pooling via its Session and transport adapters:\n\n- A Session maintains a prefix-to-adapter map and by default mounts HTTPAdapter for http:// and https://.\n- HTTPAdapter wraps urllib3’s PoolManager (or a ProxyManager when using proxies). The PoolManager caches per-origin (scheme, host, port) ConnectionPool objects and reuses connections across requests made through the same Session.\n- When Session.send is called, it selects the mounted adapter, which obtains a pool via connection_from_host and either reuses an idle connection or opens a new one.\n- Pool sizing and behavior are configurable on the adapter (pool_connections = number of pools cached, pool_maxsize = max connections per pool, pool_block = whether to block when exhausted). Retries/timeouts can also be set via the adapter.\n- Closing the Session calls each adapter’s close(), which clears the PoolManager/ProxyManagers and disposes of pooled connections."}
{"question": "How does Requests ensure backward compatibility when introducing new features?", "answer": "- Preserve a stable public API: new parameters default to old behavior, method signatures and names are kept stable, and new exceptions/types are introduced as subclasses of existing ones so existing catch blocks keep working.\n- Deprecate before removal: emit deprecation warnings, document changes and migrations, and phase out features over time; actual removals are reserved for major releases.\n- Versioning and policy: follow a clear versioning policy (breaks signaled in major versions) and enforce compatible dependency ranges at import, warning or failing fast when incompatible versions are detected.\n- Compatibility shims: maintain limited shims/aliases for legacy import paths or behaviors when safe, to bridge older code during transitions.\n- Graceful fallbacks: use optional dependencies and try/except fallbacks so functionality degrades gracefully rather than breaking outright.\n- Quality gates: comprehensive tests across supported environments to ensure new features don’t regress existing behavior, with clear release notes and migration guidance."}
{"question": "How does Requests' design facilitate integration with other HTTP libraries?", "answer": "- Transport adapter abstraction: Requests separates its high-level API from the HTTP backend via the BaseAdapter interface.\n- Session mounting: Sessions can mount adapters to URL prefixes/schemes, so different backends can handle different requests.\n- Swappable backends: The default HTTPAdapter uses urllib3, but you can write custom adapters that delegate to other libraries (e.g., httpx, aiohttp, pycurl) without changing calling code.\n- Consistent surface: Standard Request/Response objects, exceptions, and hook callbacks provide a uniform interface for error handling, instrumentation, testing, and gradual migration."}
{"question": "How does Requests implement its configuration management system?", "answer": "Requests manages configuration via a Session-centric, layered system:\n\n- Session as the config store: A Session holds persistent defaults (e.g., headers, cookies/CookieJar, auth, params, proxies, hooks, verify/cert, max_redirects, trust_env) and mounts Transport Adapters per prefix (e.g., http://, https://) to control retries and connection pooling.\n\n- Merging mechanics:\n  - When preparing a request, Session defaults are merged with per-request arguments using merge_setting (maps like headers/proxies/params), merge_cookies for cookies, and merge_hooks for hooks. Per-request values take precedence over Session defaults.\n  - When sending, if trust_env is True, merge_environment_settings folds in environment-derived settings (proxies, NO_PROXY, and CA bundle paths such as REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE/CURL_CA_BUNDLE). netrc is also consulted for auth only when trust_env is True.\n\n- Precedence:\n  - Per-request arguments > Session attributes > environment (when trust_env is enabled).\n\n- Transport layer:\n  - HTTPAdapter instances mounted on the Session implement actual I/O and can be configured (e.g., retries, pool sizes). Different adapters can be mounted for different schemes or prefixes.\n\nThere is no global mutable configuration; using requests.* helpers creates a temporary Session that applies the same merging and precedence rules."}
{"question": "How does Requests implement its session management system?", "answer": "Requests implements sessions via the Session class (requests.sessions.Session), which:\n\n- Persists defaults across requests: headers (CaseInsensitiveDict), cookies (RequestsCookieJar), auth, proxies, params, hooks, stream, verify, cert, max_redirects, and optionally environment-derived settings when trust_env is True.\n- Builds a PreparedRequest for each call by merging per-request options with session defaults; request-level values (including cookies) override session values for that request.\n- Manages cookies automatically: sends cookies from the jar and updates the session’s CookieJar from response cookies (including across redirects).\n- Sends requests through protocol-specific adapters (BaseAdapter/HTTPAdapter) selected by URL prefix via mount/get_adapter; the default HTTPAdapter provides connection pooling (keep-alive) via urllib3.\n- Handles redirects via SessionRedirectMixin (respecting allow_redirects and max_redirects).\n- Supports context management (with Session() as s: …) and explicit close(), which closes mounted adapters and releases pooled connections.\n- Allows custom adapters to be mounted for specific schemes or prefixes, enabling custom transport behavior."}
{"question": "How does Requests handle connection pooling and reuse?", "answer": "- Requests reuses connections via urllib3’s connection pooling, managed by the HTTPAdapter mounted on a Session.\n- The adapter uses a PoolManager (and a ProxyManager for proxied requests) that maintains per-origin pools keyed by scheme, host, port, and TLS context (verify/cert). Connections are automatically kept-alive and reused when these match.\n- Pool behavior is configurable: pool_connections (number of pools cached), pool_maxsize (max connections per pool), and pool_block (whether to block when exhausted).\n- Pools are thread-safe; urllib3 manages retries, timeouts, and lifecycle. Closing the Session (or adapter) closes and cleans up pooled connections.\n- Connection reuse occurs only within the same Session; the top-level requests.* calls create new sessions and do not reuse connections across calls."}
{"question": "How does Requests handle HTTP authentication?", "answer": "- Requests handles auth via pluggable classes (subclassing AuthBase) that modify requests during preparation.\n- Built-ins:\n  - HTTPBasicAuth (or simply pass (username, password)): sets the Authorization header with Base64-encoded credentials.\n  - HTTPDigestAuth: negotiates via WWW-Authenticate challenges, manages nonce/counters, and resends as required.\n  - HTTPProxyAuth: sets Proxy-Authorization for proxy servers.\n- Auth can be supplied per request (auth=...) or set as a default on a Session; it is preserved across redirects to the same host and not sent to different hosts.\n- If no auth is provided, Requests can read credentials for a host from your .netrc/_netrc (when trust_env is true).\n- For proxies, credentials can be provided via HTTPProxyAuth, embedded in the proxy URL, or picked up from proxy-related environment variables.\n- You can implement custom schemes by subclassing AuthBase."}
{"question": "How does Requests implement its retry mechanism?", "answer": "- Requests delegates retries to urllib3 via its HTTPAdapter. The adapter accepts max_retries (an int or a urllib3.util.retry.Retry instance).\n- By default retries are disabled (0). When configured, HTTPAdapter.send passes the Retry policy to urllib3’s connection pool (urlopen), which enforces:\n  - Retry counts for connect/read errors and optionally specific HTTP status codes.\n  - Method filtering (allowed_methods), status_forcelist, and redirect handling.\n  - Exponential backoff (backoff_factor) and Retry-After support.\n- When retries are exhausted, urllib3 raises MaxRetryError, which Requests wraps as requests.exceptions.RetryError (and maps other underlying errors accordingly)."}
{"question": "How does Requests facilitate integration with popular web frameworks like Flask or Django?", "answer": "- Requests doesn’t “integrate” with Flask or Django directly; it’s a framework-agnostic HTTP client used inside views, services, or background jobs to call external APIs.\n- Common patterns for smooth use in Flask/Django:\n  - Reuse a requests.Session for connection pooling and performance; consider one per process or per thread if you mutate shared state (e.g., cookies). Add retries via HTTPAdapter/urllib3 Retry.\n  - Always set timeouts; configure proxies, SSL verification, and CA bundles. Requests honors env vars like HTTP(S)_PROXY and NO_PROXY.\n  - Use hooks/adapters to inject logging, metrics, headers, and auth consistently.\n  - Stream and forward response bodies to clients when needed.\n  - For tests, use libraries like responses or requests-mock (or mount a custom adapter).\n  - In async contexts, run Requests in a thread pool or use an async client (e.g., httpx) to avoid blocking."}
{"question": "How does Requests support authentication mechanisms commonly used in APIs, such as OAuth or JWT?", "answer": "Requests natively supports HTTP Basic and Digest auth (via auth= or Session.auth). It does not include built‑in OAuth or JWT support. For those, you typically:\n\n- Send the Authorization: Bearer <token> header yourself, or implement a custom AuthBase subclass to manage tokens and refresh.\n- Use an add-on like requests-oauthlib for OAuth workflows (authorization code, client credentials, refresh).\n\nAuth can be set per request or at the session level, and hooks/callbacks can handle token refresh."}
{"question": "How does Requests handle API versioning and compatibility when interacting with evolving web services?", "answer": "Requests does not manage API versioning for web services. It’s a transport-level HTTP client: you choose the API version yourself by constructing the URL (e.g., /v1, /v2), setting headers (e.g., Accept, vendor media types, X-API-Version), or adding query params. Sessions let you define default headers/base URLs per version, and adapters/hooks/retries can be used if you need per-version behavior or custom transport.\n\nWhat Requests does handle is its own compatibility: it maintains a stable Python API, constrains/supports compatible dependency versions (e.g., urllib3, chardet/charset_normalizer), and recognizes new HTTP status codes. But negotiating or adapting to a service’s API versioning is entirely up to your application logic."}
{"question": "How does Requests implement its extension API for custom authentication handlers?", "answer": "Requests exposes a simple auth extension point via AuthBase. To create custom auth, subclass AuthBase and implement __call__(self, r), where you mutate and return the request (typically by setting Authorization or related headers). Attach your auth object per request (auth=...) or on a Session (session.auth); Requests invokes it during request preparation. Built-ins like HTTPBasicAuth and HTTPDigestAuth follow this pattern, and more complex schemes can also register response hooks (e.g., to react to 401 challenges)."}
