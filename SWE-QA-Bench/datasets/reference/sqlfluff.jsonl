{"question": "What are the core components of SQLFluff's parser?", "answer": "- Lexer: Tokenizes SQL into typed RawSegments.\n- Parser: Builds the parse tree by applying dialect-specific grammars (rooted at the dialect’s Root/File segment).\n- Grammar system: Rule classes (e.g., Sequence, OneOf, Delimited, Bracketed, Ref) defining SQL structure.\n- Segment system: BaseSegment hierarchy, including RawSegment and parsed segments (e.g., KeywordSegment, IdentifierSegment, Statement/ File segments).\n- Dialect layer: Dialect-specific grammars and segments selected via config.\n- Supporting structures: ParseContext (state/config), PositionMarker (location tracking), and error handling for unparsable segments."}
{"question": "What is SQLFluff's rule categorization system?", "answer": "SQLFluff categorizes rules using group tags defined on each rule. Every rule belongs to the “all” group; many also belong to “core” (a stable, broadly applicable default set) and one or more topical groups (e.g., layout, capitalisation, aliasing, structure/convention, naming, references). Rules have a code (e.g., L067), a name/description, and may have aliases. You can enable/disable or select rules by code, name, alias, or group (via config/CLI). Internally, the RuleSet registers rules and filters them by these groups."}
{"question": "What is the structure of SQLFluff's configuration system?", "answer": "- Core object: FluffConfig. It holds all settings as a nested dictionary and also resolves/stores runtime objects (e.g., dialect, templater). It supports hierarchical inheritance and is picklable for parallel runs.\n\n- Structure/namespacing: Top-level “core” options plus scoped sections (e.g., rules, templaters, dialect). In INI/CFG files, sections use colon namespaces:\n  [sqlfluff], [sqlfluff:rules], [sqlfluff:rules:ST01], [sqlfluff:templater:jinja], etc.\n  In pyproject.toml, the same hierarchy uses dotted tables:\n  [tool.sqlfluff], [tool.sqlfluff.rules], [tool.sqlfluff.rules.ST01], etc.\n  Per‑rule options live under their rule code. Values are type‑normalized (e.g., comma‑separated lists for rules/exclude_rules/ignore/warnings).\n\n- Sources and precedence (later overrides earlier):\n  1) Built‑in defaults + plugin‑provided defaults\n  2) User/project config files discovered by walking from the target path upward:\n     .sqlfluff; setup.cfg/tox.ini/pep8.ini ([sqlfluff] sections); pyproject.toml ([tool.sqlfluff] tables)\n  3) Optional extra config path or direct dict overrides\n  4) Command‑line options (highest precedence)\n\n- Validation/extensibility: Config dictionaries are validated; plugins can contribute default config and new sections; merging is hierarchical so subdirectories can override parent/project settings."}
{"question": "What is SQLFluff's approach to handling complex SQL constructs?", "answer": "SQLFluff tackles complex SQL with a dialect-aware, grammar-based parser and a templating step:\n\n- Templates first: It renders or masks templated SQL (e.g., Jinja) and keeps a precise mapping so rule violations map back to the original source. Template blocks are treated as non-SQL during parsing.\n- Grammar-driven parsing: Using modular, dialect-specific grammars and parser combinators, it recursively builds a hierarchical parse tree that naturally handles nesting (CTEs, subqueries, bracketed expressions) and dialect features (e.g., MERGE, procedures).\n- Error tolerance: Unparseable regions are isolated as “Unparsable” segments for recovery, allowing the rest of the file to be linted.\n- Formatting semantics: It infers implicit indentation for structured blocks (e.g., WHERE, CASE).\n- Rule execution: Lint and fix rules operate on the structured parse tree rather than raw text, enabling robust handling of complex constructs."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the BaseRule class in SQLFluff?", "answer": "BaseRule is the abstract base for all SQLFluff linting rules. It standardizes rule structure and execution by defining the rule interface (_eval), traversal/crawl behavior over the parse tree, and rule metadata (code, description, groups/docs via a metaclass); it manages rule-specific configuration, logging and error handling, and converts _eval results into lint errors and safe, template‑aware fixes (discarding unsafe ones)."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between BaseSegment and RawSegment in SQLFluff's parser?", "answer": "RawSegment is a concrete subclass of BaseSegment: BaseSegment is the common (abstract) base for all segments in SQLFluff, while RawSegment represents terminal/leaf tokens produced by the lexer—holding raw text, no child segments, and overriding base behavior for this simple case."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the RuleSet class in SQLFluff's rule management?", "answer": "RuleSet is SQLFluff’s central registry and factory for linting rules. It registers and validates rule classes (codes/names/groups/aliases), integrates plugin rules, applies and validates configuration (including allow/deny lists and per‑rule settings), and then instantiates the selected rules for runtime linting."}
{"question": "What is the role of the Lexer class in SQLFluff's parsing pipeline?", "answer": "The Lexer performs SQLFluff’s lexing stage. Given raw SQL or a templated file, it uses the active dialect’s matchers to split the input into RawSegments (tokens), maintains source/templated position mapping for precise error reporting, flags unlexable text (producing lexing errors), and appends an EOF marker. It outputs a flat sequence of segments plus any lexing errors, which feed the parser."}
{"question": "What dependencies exist between the Linter class and the Parser and Rule classes?", "answer": "- Linter → Parser: Linter instantiates/configures the Parser to turn (optionally templated) SQL into a segment/parse tree, and handles parse errors/unparsable segments.\n- Linter → Rules: Linter builds a RulePack of BaseRule implementations (including user rules), reads rule metadata (codes/names/groups/aliases, reference_map for noqa), orchestrates rule execution (e.g., crawl by lint phase), and collects/apply violations/fixes.\n- Rules → Parser: Rules operate on the Parser’s segment/AST structures.\n- No reverse dependency: Parser and Rules do not depend on Linter; the dependency is one-way from Linter to Parser and Rules."}
{"question": "What dependencies exist between SQLFluff's BaseSegment and RawSegment classes?", "answer": "- One-way dependency: RawSegment depends on BaseSegment.\n- RawSegment subclasses BaseSegment (same metaclass) and uses its core API (type system, position markers, traversal/serialization helpers), overriding behavior to be a leaf (“raw”) segment (no children, raw/raw_upper, raw_segments returns itself).\n- BaseSegment does not rely on RawSegment at runtime; any coupling is via the abstract interface (and possibly type hints), not imports or logic."}
{"question": "What dependencies exist between SQLFluff's LintedFile and LintedDir classes?", "answer": "- Unidirectional dependency: LintedDir depends on LintedFile; LintedFile does not depend on LintedDir.\n- Composition: LintedDir imports and holds a collection of LintedFile instances.\n- Delegation: LintedDir calls LintedFile methods (e.g., get/check violations, is_clean, persist/apply fixes, serialization).\n- Aggregation: LintedDir reads LintedFile attributes (e.g., path, violations, timings, parse/templating info) to compute summaries, stats, and reports.\n- Management: LintedDir can retain or discard LintedFile objects or their trees to control memory/serialization."}
{"question": "What is the relationship between SQLFluff's FormatterInterface and output generation?", "answer": "FormatterInterface is SQLFluff’s abstraction for output: it defines the callbacks the linter emits (e.g., headers, paths, violations, errors) and optional colorization. Concrete formatter classes implement this interface to turn those events into actual output—formatting and writing to a target (e.g., an output stream) while honoring settings like verbosity and color. In short, the interface specifies the output contract; implementations generate and emit the output."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff use a plugin-based architecture for custom rules instead of requiring users to modify the core codebase?", "answer": "Because it cleanly separates extensibility from the core. A plugin system lets users add, version, test, and distribute custom rules without forking or touching SQLFluff’s codebase. This keeps the core small and maintainable, enables independent updates and backward compatibility, reduces upgrade risk, and improves robustness by isolating custom logic. It also standardizes discovery/configuration via hooks, supports lazy loading for performance, and fosters a community ecosystem where teams can share and adopt rules easily."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff implement dialect-specific parsing rather than using a unified SQL parser?", "answer": "Because SQL dialects differ substantially in grammar and tokenization, a one-size-fits-all parser would be either overly permissive or inaccurate. SQLFluff uses a dialect object to provide dialect-specific lexing rules and grammar, producing correct ASTs, accurate linting/formatting, clear errors, and easier maintenance and extension without affecting other dialects."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff separate BaseSegment from RawSegment in its parser architecture?", "answer": "Because SQLFluff separates lexer tokens from parser structures. RawSegment is an immutable, atomic leaf produced by the lexer (e.g., keyword, identifier) with token-specific flags/caching and no children. BaseSegment is the composite/parser node that holds children, enforces grammar, reconstructs raw text/positions, and participates in rule logic. This split yields a clean hierarchical parse tree, efficient token handling, and clearer, more maintainable parsing and rule application."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff use a RuleSet-based approach for rule management?", "answer": "Because it centralizes and standardizes rule management. RuleSet acts as a single registry that registers and validates rules (naming, collisions, metadata), instantiates them at runtime with live configuration, and provides robust selection/filtering (allow/deny by code, name, group, alias, with globbing and clear precedence). It supports plugins via a registration decorator and enforces a consistent interface, making the system maintainable, configurable, and easily extensible."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff implement a multi-dialect SQL parser for different SQL variants?", "answer": "Because SQL dialects differ substantially across databases (syntax, keywords, functions, types, and features), a single generic parser would misparse queries and raise false positives. SQLFluff uses a multi-dialect parser so it can parse and lint accurately in diverse environments (PostgreSQL, T‑SQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.), letting users match the linter to their target database. Architecturally, it builds on a common ANSI core with dialect-specific grammar extensions and selects the configured dialect’s grammar at parse time, enabling consistent, correct linting per dialect."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff provide a fix generation system for automatic code correction?", "answer": "To turn linting into automated, reliable code improvement. SQLFluff’s fix system streamlines resolving violations by generating deterministic, safe fixes, reducing manual effort and errors, and enforcing consistent SQL standards. It’s designed with guardrails and predictability—only applying fixes when safe, preserving templated files, supporting lint–fix–lint stability, and giving users control (batch/selective fixing)—so it integrates cleanly with editors and CI/CD."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff include a template processing system for dynamic SQL files?", "answer": "Because much SQL is generated via templates (e.g., Jinja/dbt), SQLFluff renders templates into concrete SQL so it can parse, lint, and fix them accurately. It supports multiple templating engines and maintains a source-to-rendered mapping, ensuring precise error reporting and fixes back in the original templates."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff implement a noqa comment system for rule suppression?", "answer": "To let teams make granular, documented exceptions when a lint finding is intentional or unavoidable. Inline noqa comments allow local suppression by rule (or all) for false positives, legacy or templated/generated SQL, and business-policy exceptions, enabling gradual adoption without blocking work; the behavior mirrors flake8-style controls and can be restricted via config/CLI."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff's incremental parsing improve performance for large SQL files?", "answer": "Because it reuses the existing tokens/parse tree and only re-lexes/parses the parts affected by an edit. By caching results, reusing segments, and tracking dependencies to preserve context, unchanged regions are skipped, so the work scales with the size of the change rather than the size of the file, significantly reducing time and memory."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff's parallel processing reduce execution time for multiple files?", "answer": "Because SQLFluff splits the linting/parsing work for many files into chunks and runs them concurrently across multiple CPU cores (via a process pool). Results are consumed as soon as they finish, keeping workers busy and avoiding slow-file bottlenecks. This better utilizes CPU resources and reduces wall‑clock time versus serial processing. The parallel runner is avoided for a single file because startup/IPC overhead would outweigh any benefit."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff's rule caching mechanism optimize repeated linting operations?", "answer": "Because SQLFluff memoizes expensive rule/grammar computations per parse context, repeated calls with the same context hit the cache instead of recomputing. The cache is keyed by the parse context (e.g., its UUID) and is invalidated when that context changes, ensuring correctness while avoiding redundant work across passes. In addition, SQLFluff reuses the constructed RulePack and skips non‑fixing rules in later fix loops, further reducing repeated execution and speeding up linting."}
{"question": "Why does SQLFluff's selective rule application reduce processing overhead?", "answer": "Because SQLFluff avoids doing unnecessary work at both the rule-selection and rule-execution levels:\n- It pre-filters rules based on config, dialect, and disabled/excluded settings, so only applicable rules run.\n- Each rule targets only relevant segment types (via targeted crawlers) instead of scanning the entire parse tree.\n- Rules use contextual checks and early exits (e.g., skip templated sections or non-matching dialects) and track state to avoid redundant checks and fix generation.\n\nThis focused, early-return behavior reduces tree traversal, CPU, memory, and execution time."}
{"question": "Where does SQLFluff's parsing flow from source files through lexing to AST generation?", "answer": "- Orchestrator: src/sqlfluff/core/linter/linter.py\n  - load_raw_file_and_config() reads the SQL file.\n  - render_string() applies templating to produce a TemplatedFile.\n  - parse_rendered() drives lexing and parsing.\n- Lexing: parse_rendered() -> _lex_templated_file() -> Lexer.lex(...) in src/sqlfluff/core/parser/lexer.py\n  - Produces a sequence of RawSegments (tokens) with position mapping.\n- Parsing: parse_rendered() -> _parse_tokens() -> Parser.parse(...) in src/sqlfluff/core/parser/parser.py\n  - Uses the dialect’s root segment (FileSegment/RootSegment) to build a BaseSegment tree (the AST).\n  - Unparsed content is reported via SQLParseError."}
{"question": "Where does SQLFluff's rule evaluation flow from rule discovery through fix generation?", "answer": "- Discovery: The linter builds a RuleSet/RulePack from installed rules, filtered by config and dialect.\n- Orchestration: In lint_fix_parsed(), rules are run by phase across one or more loops until stable (or loop cap).\n- Traversal: For each rule, crawl() walks the parsed segment tree using crawl_behavior, creating a RuleContext for each visit and calling the rule’s _eval().\n- Evaluation: _eval() returns LintResult(s) with violations and optional LintFix edits (insert/replace/delete).\n- Filtering: crawl() respects ignore masks and templating slices, converting results into reportable errors and fix candidates.\n- Fixing: The linter validates fixes (e.g., anchor/edit safety), resolves conflicts, then applies them (apply_fixes), re-parsing/re-walking as needed.\n- Completion: The process repeats until no more valid fixes remain; violations and applied fixes are aggregated into the final linted file result."}
{"question": "Where does SQLFluff's configuration loading flow from file discovery through inheritance resolution?", "answer": "SQLFluff’s config is discovered and merged in this precedence order (earlier sources are overridden by later ones):\n\n1) Built‑in/plugin defaults\n2) User-level config:\n   - OS app config dir (platform-specific)\n   - ~/.sqlfluff\n3) Project/file discovery:\n   - Starting at the target file (or CWD) and walking up parent directories\n   - Reading supported files in each dir: .sqlfluff, setup.cfg, tox.ini, pyproject.toml\n   - Deeper (closer to the target) configs override outer ones\n4) Explicit extra_config_path (if provided) overrides all discovered configs\n5) Runtime/CLI overrides (highest precedence)\n\nFluffConfig then merges these via nested (section-aware) combination, applies core handling (e.g., dialect/templater), and resolves the final configuration."}
{"question": "Where in the SQLFluff codebase is the core SQL parser implemented?", "answer": "The core parser engine is in src/sqlfluff/core/parser/ (notably parser.py for the Parser plus supporting modules like the lexer, grammar/segment machinery, matching and context utilities). The grammar it consumes is defined per dialect under src/sqlfluff/dialects/, with dialect_ansi.py providing the base dialect."}
{"question": "Where does SQLFluff store its rule implementations?", "answer": "In the sqlfluff.rules package (src/sqlfluff/rules/), organized into category subpackages (e.g., capitalisation, references, structure, tsql, etc.), with each rule in its own module (e.g., ST01.py). The base rule class lives in src/sqlfluff/core/rules/base.py. Plugins can also provide rules."}
{"question": "Where in SQLFluff is the configuration system implemented?", "answer": "Primarily in src/sqlfluff/core/config/fluffconfig.py (the FluffConfig class), with helpers in src/sqlfluff/core/config/ (e.g., nested_combine.py), defaults in src/sqlfluff/core/default_config.cfg, rule config metadata in src/sqlfluff/core/rules/config_info.py, and CLI overrides applied in src/sqlfluff/cli/commands.py."}
{"question": "Where does SQLFluff implement its fix generation logic?", "answer": "Primarily in these core modules:\n- core/rules/fix.py: LintFix (how rules express fixes) and fix utilities.\n- core/linter/fix.py: apply_fixes (applies/combines fixes on the segment tree).\n- core/linter/patch.py: generate_source_patches/FixPatch (turns fixes into source patches).\n- core/linter/linter.py: Linter.fix/lint_fix_parsed orchestrate the fixing flow.\n\nRules that generate fixes derive from core/rules/base.py."}
{"question": "Where in SQLFluff's codebase is the \"parse\" method defined?", "answer": "- Core definition: src/sqlfluff/core/parser/parser.py — Parser.parse\n- Convenience API: src/sqlfluff/api/simple.py — parse() function"}
{"question": "Where is the \"lint\" method defined in SQLFluff's class hierarchy?", "answer": "On the Linter class in src/sqlfluff/core/linter/linter.py (i.e., Linter.lint())."}
{"question": "Where are SQLFluff's BaseRule class definitions located?", "answer": "src/sqlfluff/core/rules/base.py"}
{"question": "Where are SQLFluff's dialect-specific parser implementations located?", "answer": "In the src/sqlfluff/dialects/ package — the dialect_*.py modules (e.g., dialect_ansi.py, dialect_postgres.py) implement each dialect’s grammar and segments."}
{"question": "Where does the data flow when SQLFluff processes templated SQL from template parsing through rule application to fix generation?", "answer": "The data flows through these key stages: 1) Templater converts raw templated SQL to valid SQL, creating a TemplatedFile containing both source_str (original) and templated_str (rendered) with sliced_file mappings between them. 2) Lexer tokenizes the templated SQL into RawSegment objects representing whitespace and code. 3) Parser builds a hierarchical BaseSegment tree from tokens using dialect grammars. 4) Rule Engine traverses the tree, with each rule receiving a RuleContext containing the current segment, parent_stack, templated_file, and config, returning LintFix objects for violations. 5) Fix Application processes LintFix objects (create_before, create_after, replace, delete operations) to modify the tree. 6) Output maps fixes back to original file positions using TemplatedFile slice mappings, generating the final corrected SQL string."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff implement its SQL parsing system?", "answer": "- Pipeline: SQLFluff uses a multi-stage flow—templating → lexing → parsing—coordinated by the linter.\n- Templating: Raw SQL is first rendered (e.g., Jinja/dbt) to resolve dynamic content while tracking source positions.\n- Lexing: A dialect-driven lexer tokenizes the rendered SQL into RawSegments using dialect-specific patterns.\n- Parsing: The Parser (configured via FluffConfig) creates a ParseContext and delegates to the dialect’s RootSegment, which applies recursive grammar rules (e.g., Sequence, OneOf, Bracketed) to build a hierarchical tree of BaseSegments (with RawSegments as leaves).\n- Dialects and validation: Parsing is dialect-agnostic at the core but uses dialect-defined grammars; completeness checks ensure no input is dropped.\n- Errors and output: Unparsable regions are wrapped as UnparsableSegment and/or raised as SQLParseError; the resulting parse tree (with precise position tracking) is returned for linting or API use."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff's rule system work?", "answer": "- Rules are Python classes that inherit from BaseRule. They’re auto-registered (via a metaclass) with canonical code (e.g., L003), name, description, groups, aliases, and per‑rule config keywords.\n- RuleSet assembles the active rules from built‑ins and plugins, honoring configuration: enable/disable by code, name, group, or alias, plus per‑rule options.\n- Linting flow: SQL is parsed into a segment tree. For each active rule, a crawler defines which segments to visit; the framework calls the rule’s _eval(context) on those segments.\n- _eval returns None or one/more LintResult objects describing violations and, optionally, LintFix edits for autofix. Fixes are applied safely (e.g., avoiding templated regions), with iterative reparse/re-lint until stable.\n- Metadata is queryable (e.g., list_rules), and rules include built‑in validation/documentation support.\n- Custom rules are supported via plugins."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff implement its plugin system for custom rules?", "answer": "SQLFluff’s custom rule plugins are implemented with pluggy and discovered via Python entry points. A plugin package exposes pluggy hook implementations (decorated with @hookimpl), chiefly:\n- get_rules(): returns a list of BaseRule subclasses (your custom rules).\n- load_default_config(): supplies default config for the plugin.\n- get_configs_info(): provides config metadata/validation.\n\nAt runtime, SQLFluff’s plugin manager collects these via the hooks, builds a RuleSet by registering the returned BaseRule classes, and integrates their config. Each rule implements _eval() and can emit fixes."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff implement its multi-dialect support system?", "answer": "SQLFluff uses a modular, registry-based design. A base Dialect class provides the common machinery for lexer configuration, segment/grammar management, and resolution. Each dialect lives in its own module under sqlfluff.dialects and is created by copying/inheriting from another dialect (typically ansi) and then overriding or adding segments, grammar rules, keyword lists, and lexer matchers (with facilities to replace/patch/insert). A central lookup maps dialect names to modules; dialects are imported on demand and their module-level segments are registered with the Dialect. Dialects carry metadata (label, formatted name, docstring, inherits_from) to model inheritance and support inspection. Users select the dialect via config/CLI, and the tokenizer/parser (and rules) operate using the selected dialect’s definitions."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff handle different SQL dialects and syntax variations?", "answer": "SQLFluff supports multiple SQL dialects through a pluggable, inheritance-based dialect system. A core ANSI dialect supplies common grammar; each specific dialect (e.g., PostgreSQL, BigQuery, T‑SQL) extends or overrides it with its own keyword sets, grammar segments, and lexer matchers (e.g., quote styles, operators, scripting blocks). The active dialect is chosen via configuration or CLI, and the lexer, parser, and linter all operate with that dialect, making rules and messages dialect‑aware. Dialect‑specific options can be configured, and SQLFluff maintains per‑dialect tests to validate syntax variations."}
{"question": "How do different SQLFluff linting rules interact with the parsed SQL structure?", "answer": "- SQLFluff first parses the SQL into a dialect-specific tree of BaseSegment nodes (the concrete syntax/structure).\n- Each rule (a BaseRule) is run independently over that same tree. The engine “crawls” the tree and calls the rule’s _eval on each segment with a RuleContext (current segment, parents/siblings, dialect, config, templating info). Rules typically pattern-match on segment types and relationships (e.g., aliasing, select targets) and may keep per-run memory to avoid duplicate findings.\n- When a rule finds an issue, it returns one or more LintResult objects, each anchored to a specific segment span and optionally carrying LintFix objects (create_before/create_after/replace/delete) plus a description.\n- Rules do not mutate the tree directly. The linter collects fixes from all rules, filters them for safety (e.g., template conflicts, overlapping or contradictory edits), and applies them to the raw segments, then reparses to validate. Unsafe/unparseable fix sets are reduced or discarded.\n- Multiple rules can flag the same structural element; results are aggregated, and overlapping fixes are de-conflicted. Findings are reported with precise locations tied to the parsed segments.\n- Configuration controls which rules run and rule behavior; performance is maintained by targeted traversal and reuse of parsing across rules."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff implement its fix system?", "answer": "- Representation: Rules don’t edit text directly. When they find a violation, they return LintResult objects that carry LintFix items. A LintFix anchors to a specific segment in the parsed tree and specifies an operation such as delete, replace/edit, create_before, or create_after, along with any replacement segments.\n\n- Orchestration: The Linter parses the SQL, runs the rule set, collects all proposed fixes, and applies them in multiple passes until no more fixes apply or a runaway_limit is reached (to prevent infinite loops). Changes can unlock further fixes, hence the multi-pass design.\n\n- Application: A central fix application routine orders fixes deterministically, rejects conflicting/overlapping ones, and respects protected/templated regions. Fixes are applied to the segment tree (not naive text search/replace), then the SQL is re-rendered with a “reflow” step to correctly manage whitespace and layout. Problematic fixes (e.g., those that would create unparsable SQL) are skipped, and unparsable sections are handled conservatively unless configured via fix_even_unparsable.\n\n- Entry points and output: Via CLI (sqlfluff fix) for files and via the Python API (e.g., sqlfluff.fix() or Linter.fix()) for strings or programmatic use. The CLI can write in place or to a separate file using a configurable fixed-suffix. The API returns the fixed SQL string.\n\nIn short, SQLFluff implements fixing as rule-proposed, segment-anchored edits applied safely and iteratively to the parsed tree, with conflict resolution, formatting/reflow, and convergence safeguards."}
{"question": "How does SQLFluff handle template processing in SQL files?", "answer": "SQLFluff renders templates first, then lints the result. It uses pluggable templaters (e.g., Jinja, dbt, Python, Placeholder, Raw) selected via config. The templater renders the file with the provided context and returns a TemplatedFile containing:\n- the original template text,\n- the rendered SQL,\n- a precise slice map linking output back to source and marking literal vs. templated/generated regions.\n\nSQLFluff then lexes/parses the rendered SQL but uses the slice map to:\n- report violations at the correct locations in the original file,\n- avoid or limit fixes inside templated-only regions,\n- surface clear templating errors if rendering fails.\n\nConditionals, loops, and variables are handled by the templater during rendering; SQLFluff retains awareness of the original structure through the slice mapping."}
{"question": "How can SQLFluff's plugin API be used to create custom linting rules?", "answer": "- Create a Python package for your plugin.\n- Define one or more rule classes that subclass SQLFluff’s BaseRule. Set metadata (e.g., code, name, description, groups), optional flags (e.g., is_fix_compatible), config_keywords for user-configurable options, and an optional crawl_behaviour.\n- Implement the _eval(self, context) method. Use the RuleContext to inspect the parsed tree and return LintResult(s) with an anchor, description, and optional fixes.\n- Expose the rules via a plugin hook: implement get_rules() that returns your rule classes (decorate with the plugin hook decorator).\n- Register the plugin with SQLFluff via setuptools/pyproject entry_points so it’s discoverable; then install the package.\n- Configure and use: set rule options in .sqlfluff via their config_keywords, enable/disable by rule code, and verify with sqlfluff list rules."}
{"question": "How can SQLFluff's configuration API be used to implement dynamic rule loading?", "answer": "- SQLFluff loads rules dynamically via its plugin system. Plugins expose rules through a get_rules hook (and can expose defaults via get_configs_info).\n- For each lint run, SQLFluff builds a FluffConfig by merging defaults (core and plugin), project/user config (.sqlfluff), CLI/runtime options, and inline directives.\n- The RuleSet uses this config to register and instantiate rules from both the core and plugins, then filters them according to the “rules” setting (allow/deny lists, groups) and per-file/inline overrides.\n- Rule classes advertise configurable options via config_keywords; plugin defaults can be provided with load_default_config/load_config_resource and are merged automatically.\n- Because config is hierarchical and file-aware, the active set of rules is determined at runtime per context/file—i.e., rules are “dynamically loaded” and configured based on the resolved FluffConfig."}
{"question": "How can SQLFluff's BaseRule API be extended to implement new rule types?", "answer": "To extend SQLFluff's BaseRule API for new rule types: 1) Create a class inheriting from BaseRule with naming convention Rule_XXXX (where XXXX is 2-4 letters + 2 digits like LT01, CP01); 2) Define required attributes: groups (must include 'all'), name (optional), aliases (optional), config_keywords (for configuration), crawl_behaviour (crawler type), is_fix_compatible (boolean); 3) Implement _eval(context: RuleContext) method that returns LintResult, list[LintResult], or None; 4) Set crawl_behaviour to appropriate crawler (RootOnlyCrawler for full tree, SegmentSeekerCrawler for specific segments, ParentOfSegmentCrawler for parent-child relationships); 5) Register rule using @ruleset.register decorator; 6) Configure via config_keywords and handle in __init__ if needed. The rule class name determines the code automatically via metaclass."}
{"question": "How can SQLFluff's fix API be leveraged for custom code transformations?", "answer": "SQLFluff's fix API enables custom code transformations through several key mechanisms: 1) **Custom Rules with Fixes**: Create custom rules inheriting from `BaseRule`, set `is_fix_compatible = True`, and return `LintResult` objects with `LintFix` instances in the `_eval()` method. 2) **LintFix Operations**: Use four fix types - `LintFix.delete()` to remove segments, `LintFix.replace()` to substitute content, `LintFix.create_before()` and `LintFix.create_after()` to insert content. 3) **Simple API Integration**: Apply transformations via `sqlfluff.fix(sql, rules=['custom_rule'])` to target specific custom rules, or use `config` parameter with custom rule configurations. 4) **Plugin System**: Package custom transformation rules as plugins for distribution and reuse across projects. 5) **Template Safety**: The fix system automatically handles template conflicts and source mapping to prevent corruption of Jinja/dbt templates. This approach allows organizations to implement domain-specific SQL transformations while leveraging SQLFluff's robust parsing and fix application infrastructure."}
