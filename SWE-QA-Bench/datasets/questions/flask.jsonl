This pattern enables several benefits: 1) Testing - multiple application instances can be created with different configurations for testing various scenarios, 2) Multiple instances - different versions of the same application can run in the same process with different configurations, 3) Lazy loading - the application is only created when needed, avoiding circular import issues. The factory pattern is supported by Flask's CLI system (src/flask/cli.py:37-91) which can automatically detect and call factory functions.
