The integration includes: 1) Installation of pytest-django plugin that extends pytest's functionality for Django applications, 2) Configuration through Django settings using --ds command-line option to specify Django settings module, 3) Automatic Django setup and teardown for test sessions including database configuration and management, 4) Integration with Django's test client for making HTTP requests and testing views, 5) Support for Django fixtures and model testing with automatic database transaction management, 6) Integration with Django's ORM for database operations during testing, 7) Support for Django's middleware and authentication systems in test environment, 8) Configuration options in pytest.ini or pyproject.toml for Django-specific settings, 9) Integration with Django's test discovery and test runner compatibility, 10) Support for Django's static files and media handling during tests, 11) Integration with Django's cache and session management for testing, 12) Plugin architecture that allows pytest-django to hook into pytest's test execution lifecycle.", "score": null}
{"question": "How does Pytest facilitate testing RESTful APIs with the requests library?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "Pytest facilitates testing RESTful APIs with the requests library through several built-in mechanisms: 1) The monkeypatch fixture that allows mocking of requests.get, requests.post, and other HTTP methods to return controlled test responses, 2) MockResponse class pattern for creating custom response objects that simulate requests.Response behavior with methods like json() and properties like status_code, 3) Automatic cleanup of monkeypatched requests methods after each test to prevent test pollution, 4) Fixture-based mocking where requests methods can be mocked globally using autouse fixtures in conftest.py, 5) Context-based patching using monkeypatch.context() for scoped mocking of requests functionality, 6) Integration with pytest's assertion system for validating API response data, status codes, and headers, 7) Support for testing different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) through targeted mocking, 8) Error handling testing by mocking requests to raise exceptions like ConnectionError or HTTPError, 9) Parameterized testing support for testing multiple API endpoints with different request parameters, 10) Integration with pytest's test discovery and execution for organizing API tests, 11) Support for testing authentication and headers through mock response configuration, 12) Global request prevention using monkeypatch.delattr() to block all HTTP requests during testing.", "score": null}
{"question": "How does Pytest support parameterized testing for different API endpoints?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "Pytest supports parameterized testing for different API endpoints through multiple mechanisms: 1) @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator that allows defining multiple sets of arguments for test functions, enabling testing of different endpoints with various parameters, 2) Metafunc.parametrize() method that can be called within pytest_generate_tests hook for dynamic parametrization based on configuration or external data, 3) Support for multiple parametrize decorators that can be stacked to test combinations of different HTTP methods, endpoints, and parameters, 4) Custom ID generation through the ids parameter to provide meaningful test names for different API endpoint combinations, 5) Integration with pytest's test discovery and execution system for organizing API endpoint tests, 6) Support for indirect parametrization where endpoint URLs or parameters can be passed as fixtures for more complex setup, 7) Command-line driven parametrization through pytest_addoption and pytest_generate_tests hooks for dynamic endpoint selection, 8) Scenario-based testing where different API endpoint scenarios can be defined and tested systematically, 9) Integration with monkeypatch fixture for mocking different API responses based on parametrized endpoints, 10) Support for testing different HTTP status codes, response formats, and error conditions across multiple endpoints, 11) Class-level parametrization where all test methods in a class can be parametrized for different API endpoints, 12) Module-level parametrization using pytestmark for applying endpoint parameters to all tests in a module.", "score": null}
