The configuration API for dynamic rule loading works as follows: 1) Rule Discovery - The configuration system can discover and load rules dynamically based on configuration settings, supporting both built-in and plugin rules; 2) Rule Filtering - Configuration allows filtering rules by various criteria including rule codes, names, groups, and aliases through include/exclude patterns; 3) Rule Enablement - Rules can be dynamically enabled or disabled through configuration settings, allowing for flexible rule sets based on project requirements; 4) Rule Configuration - Each rule can have its own configuration parameters that are loaded dynamically and can be customized per project or environment; 5) Plugin Integration - The configuration system integrates with the plugin system to load custom rules from external packages based on configuration settings; 6) Rule Set Management - Configuration supports defining multiple rule sets that can be loaded and applied dynamically based on context or conditions; 7) Hierarchical Configuration - Rules can be configured at different levels (global, project, file-specific) with proper inheritance and override mechanisms; 8) Validation - The configuration system validates rule configurations and provides error messages for invalid settings; 9) Documentation Integration - Dynamic rule loading integrates with SQLFluff's help system to provide documentation for loaded rules; 10) Performance Optimization - The configuration system caches rule configurations and loading results to improve performance for repeated operations.", "score": null}
{"question": "How can SQLFluff's fix API be leveraged for custom code transformations?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "SQLFluff's fix API can be leveraged for custom code transformations through its comprehensive fix generation and application system that provides precise control over SQL code modifications. The fix API for custom transformations works as follows: 1) LintFix Creation - Custom transformations can create LintFix objects that describe specific changes including create, edit, or delete operations on segments; 2) Segment Manipulation - The fix API provides methods to manipulate segments in the parse tree, allowing for complex transformations like restructuring SQL statements; 3) Position-Aware Changes - Fixes maintain accurate position information, enabling precise transformations that preserve code structure and formatting; 4) Batch Operations - Multiple fixes can be generated and applied together, allowing for complex multi-step transformations; 5) Context Preservation - The fix system maintains context information during transformations, ensuring that changes are applied correctly within the broader SQL structure; 6) Validation Integration - Custom transformations can leverage SQLFluff's validation system to ensure that generated code is syntactically correct; 7) Template Awareness - The fix API is template-aware, allowing transformations to work correctly with templated SQL while preserving template structure; 8) Error Handling - Custom transformations can implement error handling to gracefully handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages; 9) Performance Optimization - The fix API supports efficient transformations through caching and optimized segment manipulation; 10) Integration with Rules - Custom transformations can be integrated with linting rules to provide automatic code improvements based on detected issues.", "score": null}
