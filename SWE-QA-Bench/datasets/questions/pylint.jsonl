PyLinter provides checkers with access to shared resources like the configuration system, message handling, and AST data. During analysis, PyLinter orchestrates the execution of checkers by calling their lifecycle methods (open, close) and delegating AST traversal to the ASTWalker, which then calls the appropriate visit and leave methods on each checker. PyLinter also provides checkers with utility methods for message creation and configuration access.

Astroid's type inference system enables sophisticated type-related checks, while its import resolution capabilities allow checkers to analyze cross-module dependencies. The checker system depends on astroid's ability to handle syntax errors gracefully and provide detailed location information for diagnostic messages. Astroid's transformation capabilities, such as decorator expansion and class hierarchy analysis, enable checkers to perform more accurate analysis.

The ASTWalker class calls these methods when it encounters FunctionDef nodes during AST traversal, but the actual implementation is provided by each individual checker that registers for function definition analysis.", "score": null}
{"question": "Where is the \"add_message\" method defined in the message reporting hierarchy?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "The \"add_message\" method is defined in the BaseChecker class, which serves as the foundation for all Pylint checkers. This method is inherited by all checker classes that extend BaseChecker. The add_message method is responsible for creating and registering diagnostic messages with the PyLinter instance.

The method integrates with Pylint's message system to ensure proper formatting, filtering, and reporting of diagnostic messages. Since all checkers inherit from BaseChecker, they all have access to this method for generating diagnostic output. The method is part of the core message reporting infrastructure that allows checkers to communicate their findings to users through the configured reporters.", "score": null}
