{"question": "How can SymPy's domain API be extended to implement new mathematical domains?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "SymPy's domain API can be extended to implement new mathematical domains by creating custom domain classes that inherit from the appropriate base classes and implement the required mathematical operations. The extension process involves several key steps: 1) Base class selection - Choose the appropriate base class (Domain, Ring, Field, SimpleDomain, or CompositeDomain) based on the mathematical structure being implemented. For example, inherit from Field for structures that support division, or Ring for structures without division. 2) Element type definition - Define a dtype class that represents elements of the domain, implementing arithmetic operations (__add__, __mul__, __pow__, etc.) and comparison operations appropriate for the mathematical structure. 3) Domain methods implementation - Implement required domain methods including: from_sympy() and to_sympy() for conversion between SymPy expressions and domain elements, convert_from() for inter-domain conversion, and arithmetic operations specific to the domain. 4) Mathematical properties - Define properties like is_Ring, is_Field, is_PID (Principal Ideal Domain), is_Exact, characteristic, etc. that describe the mathematical nature of the domain. 5) Associated domains - If applicable, implement get_ring() and get_field() methods to provide associated ring/field structures, and has_assoc_Ring/has_assoc_Field properties. 6) Specialized algorithms - Implement domain-specific algorithms for operations like gcd(), lcm(), factorization, and other mathematical operations relevant to the domain. 7) Integration with Poly - Ensure the domain works correctly with the Poly class by properly handling coefficient operations and domain unification. 8) Testing and validation - Create comprehensive tests to verify mathematical correctness and integration with existing SymPy functionality. This extension mechanism allows users to add support for new mathematical structures while maintaining compatibility with SymPy's polynomial system and broader mathematical framework.", "score": null}
{"question": "How can SymPy's pattern matching API be leveraged for custom expression transformations?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "SymPy's pattern matching API can be leveraged for custom expression transformations through several powerful mechanisms that enable sophisticated symbolic manipulation. The main approaches include: 1) Wild symbol patterns - Create patterns using Wild('a'), Wild('b') with optional exclude and properties parameters to match specific types of subexpressions. For example, Wild('n', properties=[lambda x: x.is_integer]) matches only integer expressions. 2) match() method usage - Use expr.match(pattern) to find substitutions that make the pattern match the expression, returning a dictionary mapping Wild symbols to matched subexpressions. This enables structural analysis and extraction. 3) replace() with patterns - Use expr.replace(pattern, replacement) where pattern contains Wild symbols to perform systematic transformations. The replacement can be a function that receives the matched dictionary and returns the transformed expression. 4) Custom matches() methods - Implement custom matches() methods in expression classes to define specialized matching behavior for specific expression types, enabling domain-specific pattern recognition. 5) Unification for advanced matching - Use the sympy.unify module for more sophisticated pattern matching that handles commutative and associative operations, enabling matching across different but equivalent expression structures. 6) Conditional transformations - Combine pattern matching with conditional logic to apply transformations only when specific mathematical conditions are met, using the assumptions system to guide transformations. 7) Multi-pattern strategies - Use the sympy.strategies framework to apply multiple pattern-based transformations systematically, with canonicalization and exhaustive application strategies. 8) Rewrite rules - Create rewrite rules using patterns that can be applied systematically to transform expressions according to mathematical identities and simplification rules. This API enables users to implement sophisticated symbolic manipulation algorithms, custom simplification rules, and domain-specific transformations while leveraging SymPy's robust pattern matching infrastructure.", "score": null}
{"question": "How can SymPy's assumption API be used to implement custom symbolic reasoning?", "answer": null, "relative_code_list": null, "ground_truth": "SymPy's assumption API can be used to implement custom symbolic reasoning by extending the assumption system with new predicates, handlers, and reasoning rules. The implementation involves several key approaches: 1) Custom assumption predicates - Define new predicates by creating classes that inherit from Predicate and implement the necessary logic for the mathematical property. These predicates can then be used in queries and reasoning. 2) Handler methods - Implement _eval_is_* methods in expression classes to provide custom logic for determining assumption properties. For example, _eval_is_positive() can implement domain-specific logic for determining when an expression is positive. 3) Implication rules - Extend the assumption system by adding new implication rules that define logical relationships between predicates. These rules enable the system to derive new conclusions from existing assumptions. 4) ask() function integration - Use the ask() function with custom predicates to perform sophisticated queries about expression properties, enabling complex symbolic reasoning workflows. 5) Context managers - Create assumption contexts using assuming() to temporarily add assumptions for specific reasoning tasks, enabling conditional symbolic manipulation. 6) Custom fact systems - Implement custom knowledge bases that encode domain-specific mathematical facts and relationships, allowing specialized reasoning in particular mathematical domains. 7) Assumption propagation - Implement logic for propagating assumptions through expression trees, ensuring that derived expressions inherit appropriate mathematical properties from their components. 8) Integration with operations - Design custom operations and simplifications that respect and utilize assumptions, enabling assumption-aware symbolic computation. 9) Symbolic constraint solving - Use assumptions to represent and solve symbolic constraint systems, enabling reasoning about symbolic inequalities and conditional expressions. This framework allows users to build sophisticated symbolic reasoning systems that can handle domain-specific mathematical knowledge while integrating seamlessly with SymPy's existing assumption infrastructure.", "score": null}
